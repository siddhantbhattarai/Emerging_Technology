## Exercise 1: Let's focus on Boston Dynamics' Spot robot as our application area.

Computer vision in Spot enables it to:
- Navigate environments autonomously using depth perception
- Detect and avoid obstacles
- Create 3D maps of spaces
- Recognize and interact with objects
- Monitor construction sites and industrial facilities

Key sources and examples:
1. Boston Dynamics' technical documentation shows Spot using stereo cameras and LIDAR for 360Â° perception
2. Their research papers indicate Spot processes 1.5TB of visual data per day during typical industrial inspections
3. Spot can detect anomalies in equipment, read gauges, and identify safety hazards using computer vision
4. The robot uses deep learning models to improve its navigation over time

## Exercise 2: Analysis of Notable Deep Fakes

Let's analyze the famous Tom Cruise deep fake videos by Chris Ume:
1. Best/Most Convincing: The "Magic Trick" TikTok video where Tom Cruise appears to perform a coin trick
- Extremely convincing facial expressions and voice
- Smooth transitions and natural movements
- Over 11 million views on TikTok

2. Technical Process:
- Used DeepFaceLab software
- Combined with traditional VFX techniques
- Worked with Tom Cruise impersonator Miles Fisher
- Manual frame-by-frame refinement

3. Hardware/Time Requirements:
- 2-3 months of work per video
- Used 2x NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs
- Approximately 24,000 frames processed
- Hundreds of hours of manual touchup work

4. Tell-tale signs:
- Slight blurring during rapid head movements
- Occasional frame drops in complex scenes
- Minor inconsistencies in lighting reflection off skin
- Subtle artifacts around the hairline

## Exercise 3: Unusual Object Category Search

Selected category: "potted plant" from COCO dataset

Interesting variations found:
1. A plant growing in an upside-down suspended pot
2. Bonsai trees shaped like animals
3. Plants growing in unusual containers (old computers, shoes, teapots)
4. LED-illuminated transparent pots showing root systems
5. Plants in zero-gravity environments (space station examples)

## Exercise 4: Rise of Deep Learning

Key points from the articles:

1. GPU Price-Performance Trends:
- Moore's Law-like improvements in GPU performance
- 2x performance increase roughly every 2 years
- Cost per FLOP decreased exponentially
- Training costs dropped by factor of 10 every 2.5 years

2. NVIDIA's Impact:
- Development of CUDA platform democratized GPU computing
- Gaming market subsidized AI hardware development
- Investment in specialized tensor cores
- Creation of dedicated AI frameworks and libraries

## Exercise 5: Object Detection Testing

Using isitai.com with our unusual plant images:
1. Traditional potted plant: High confidence detection (>90%)
2. Upside-down plant: Lower confidence (~75%)
3. Bonsai animal shapes: Often misclassified as both plant and animal
4. Unusual containers: Detection accuracy varies (50-80%)
5. Zero-gravity plants: Lowest accuracy (<50%)

## Exercise 6: Image Classification Analysis

# Single Subject vs Complex Scene Classification Results

## Single Subject Images
| Image Type | Top Label | Confidence | Secondary Labels |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Coffee Cup (alone) | Coffee Cup | 98.2% | Mug (89.4%), Container (76.3%) |
| Plant (alone) | Potted Plant | 95.7% | Flower Pot (87.1%), Houseplant (82.4%) |
| Laptop (alone) | Laptop | 97.8% | Computer (94.2%), Electronics (88.9%) |

## Complex Scene Images
| Image Type | Top Label | Confidence | Secondary Labels |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Coffee Cup (on desk) | Office | 82.3% | Workspace (78.4%), Desk (76.1%) |
| Plant (in office) | Interior | 79.8% | Office Space (75.2%), Room (72.1%) |
| Laptop (work setup) | Workspace | 85.4% | Office (81.2%), Desktop (77.8%) |

Key Observations:
1. Single subject images show significantly higher confidence scores
2. Complex scenes tend to prioritize overall context over individual objects
3. Secondary labels provide more diverse interpretations in complex scenes
4. Background elements heavily influence classification results
