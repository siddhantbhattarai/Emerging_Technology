## 1. Introduction

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a theoretical form of AI that would match or exceed human-level cognitive abilities across virtually any domain. Unlike narrow AI systems that excel at specific tasks, AGI would demonstrate human-like flexibility, learning capability, and general problem-solving skills. This technology stands at the intersection of computer science, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience, promising to revolutionize how we approach complex problems and interact with intelligent systems.
